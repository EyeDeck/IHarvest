COMPATIBILITY:
	This mod was made for Skyrim Special Edition v1.5+.
	
	It seems to work with Skyrim VR, but this has not been thoroughly tested.
	
	Unfortunately this mod is NOT compatible with Skyrim LE/Oldrim, as the 
	plugin file was originally created using the 64-bit Creation Kit,
	using models and textures from the 64-bit version of the game. At the time
	of writing, there is no automatic method of backporting mods from SSE
	to Oldrim, and I do not have the patience to recreate the mod from scratch
	for a version of a game that I don't intend to play. As the mod is WTFPL
	licensed, however, anyone who wants to is free to attempt that themselves.

INSTALLATION:
	If you are using Mod Organizer 2, Vortex, or Nexus Mod Manager, 
	installation using your mod manager's FOMOD installer is recommended.
	
	For manual installation, extract IHarvest.esl and IHarvest.bsa into your
	Skyrim Special Edition\Data directory, and activate IHarvest.esl using
	the in-game mod manager.
	
	To manually install the Vanilla Fixes module, also extract Scripts\, and
	IHarvestVanillaFixes.esp. If you are using USSEP v4.2.0+, you may skip
	the .esp file, as it is already included.
	
	For Skyrim VR users, follow the same procedure, except rename IHarvest.esl
	to IHarvest.esp; then, locate your plugins.txt and add the plugin manually.
	
	Also included is 'Collect Gatherable Projectiles for IHarvest.pas', which
	is a script for xEdit that may be used to allow IHarvest Getter Critters
	to collect arrows, bolts and other recoverable projectiles. Instructions
	for its use are in the .pas file, which may be opened as a text file.
